## v-sacred-cosmic-evolving-2026-02-28
**Status:** Current stable baseline

### What is in this version
- **Sacred/Cosmic style toggle** — same hash, two visual interpretations
- **Sacred style** — clean parallax, single symmetry, consecutive connections, smaller dots, stable form for meditation
- **Cosmic style** — evolving geometry, connection skip cycles through polygon families over time, secondary symmetry interference layer, Lissajous overlay that continuously morphs, never exactly repeats
- **Parallax depth-of-field** — inner rings rotate faster than outer rings, 6x speed differential
- **Counterclockwise rotation** — via direct coordinate math, not ctx.rotate()
- **Hash-seeded breathing** — pulse amplitude and speed unique per intention
- **7.83 Hz Schumann heartbeat** — Earth's electromagnetic frequency, pure bass pulse
- **HRS/MIN/SEC scroll wheel timer** — iPhone-style picker, from 1 second to 2h 59m 59s
- **Spiral dissolve** — mandala collapses inward at session end, audio fades simultaneously
- **Nebula effect** — Lissajous overlay creates cosmic nebula during dissolve
- **My Intentions storage** — localStorage, click any past intention to regenerate its mandala
- **Begin New Session** — full page reload for clean state
- **Mobile responsive** — canvas scales to any screen size
- **MERIDIAN-HASH** — SHA-256 cryptographic signature displayed on canvas, provenance record
